============

I listen to a lot of music - particularly while I'm working.

My default mode is to just ask my Google Home to play music by a particular
artist. But I've noticed recently that I tend to gravitate to a very small
set of artists and I wanted to expand that a bit.

This program is an attempt to fix that. It looks at my all-time listening
stats on [Last.FM](https://www.last.fm/user/davorg/library/artists), gets
a list of the artists I've listened to between 500 and 1,000 times and
then picks one of those at random.

That way I hope to get artists that I like (so I've listened to them
over 500 times) but that I don't listen to a lot.
